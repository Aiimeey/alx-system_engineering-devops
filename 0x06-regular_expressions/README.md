## *0x06. Regular Expression*
### *Project Description*

This project, "0x06. Regular Expression," is part of the ALX System Engineering and DevOps curriculum. It focuses on
understanding and implementing regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, which is commonly used with Ruby.

In this project, you will work with regular expressions and build Ruby scripts to match specific patterns and
extract information from text data. Each task is designed to help you practice and gain expertise in working with
regular expressions.
