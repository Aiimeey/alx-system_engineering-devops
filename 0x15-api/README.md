Project: API Data Management with Python
Description

This project focuses on leveraging Python scripting to interact with a REST API, specifically for managing employee data. The goal is to gather information about an employee's TODO list progress, export the data to CSV and JSON formats, and adhere to Pythonic coding conventions.
Learning Objectives

    Understand the limitations of Bash scripting for certain tasks.
    Comprehend the concepts of APIs, REST APIs, and microservices.
    Familiarity with CSV and JSON formats.
    Adhere to Python style guidelines (PEP8).
    Recognize Pythonic naming conventions for packages, modules, classes, variables, functions, and constants.

Tasks
Task 0: Gather Data from an API

Write a Python script that utilizes a given REST API to fetch and display TODO list progress for a specified employee ID.
Task 1: Export to CSV

Extend the script from Task 0 to export the employee's task data in CSV format. The exported file should be named USER_ID.csv.
Task 2: Export to JSON

Extend the script from Task 0 to export the employee's task data in JSON format. The exported file should be named USER_ID.json.
