### 0x09. Web infrastructure design

Introduction:
This project not only challenges your technical prowess but also emphasizes the importance of understanding fundamental concepts such as DNS, load balancing, server redundancy, and security protocols. Each task requires you to whiteboard your designs, explaining the rationale behind each component and addressing potential issues that may arise.
0. Simple web stack

Requirements:

    Design a one-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.
    Components: 1 server, 1 Nginx web server, 1 application server, 1 MySQL database, 1 domain name (foobar.com), and specific configurations.
    Explain the role of each component and identify issues with this setup.



1. Distributed web infrastructure

Requirements:

    Design a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.
    Additional components: 2 servers, 1 load balancer (HAproxy).
    Explain reasons for each addition, load balancer setup, Primary-Replica cluster, and identify issues.

2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

Requirements:

    Design a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com with security and monitoring.
    Additional components: 3 firewalls, SSL certificate for HTTPS, 3 monitoring clients.
    Explain reasons for each addition, the purpose of firewalls, HTTPS, monitoring, and identify issues.
