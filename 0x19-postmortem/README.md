### Issue Summary:

    #### Duration:
        Start Time: February 17, 2024, 10:00 PM PST
        End Time: February 18, 2024, 2:00 AM PST

    #### Impact:
        The outage affected our primary web application, causing intermittent service disruptions and slowdowns. Approximately 30% of users experienced difficulties accessing the platform or encountered significant delays in page loading times.

    #### Root Cause:
        The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer, leading to uneven distribution of traffic across backend servers.

### Timeline:

    10:05 PM PST:
        Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating unusual traffic patterns and increased latency.

    10:10 PM PST:
        Engineering team notified of the issue.

    10:15 PM PST:
        Initial investigation focused on backend server health and database performance, suspecting a potential bottleneck.

    10:45 PM PST:
        Load balancer configuration reviewed, noticing inconsistencies in routing rules.

    11:15 PM PST:
        Misleading assumption made about a potential DDoS attack due to the unusual traffic pattern.

    11:30 PM PST:
        Incident escalated to senior engineering management for further assistance.

    12:00 AM PST:
        Load balancer configuration validated as the root cause of the issue.

    12:30 AM PST:
        Load balancer settings corrected to evenly distribute traffic across backend servers.

    1:30 AM PST:
        Service fully restored and confirmed stable by monitoring tools.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

    #### Root Cause:
        The misconfigured load balancer was causing uneven distribution of traffic, overloading some backend servers while leaving others underutilized.

    #### Resolution:
        Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all available backend servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and improved performance.

###  Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    #### Improvements/Fixes:
        Regular audits of load balancer configurations to identify and address any misconfigurations promptly.
        Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal traffic patterns and misconfigured components more efficiently.

    #### Tasks to Address the Issue:
        Implement automated load balancer configuration checks as part of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
        Conduct a thorough review of system documentation to ensure accurate and up-to-date information regarding load balancer configuration best practices.
        Schedule regular load balancer configuration reviews and audits to prevent similar incidents in the future.
