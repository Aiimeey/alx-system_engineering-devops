## *Bash Scripting Project: Loops, Conditions, and Parsing*  

### *Introduction*

This project is a part of the DevOps and Shell Scripting curriculum,
designed to enhance your Bash scripting skills and deepen your understanding of essential concepts such as loops,
conditions, and parsing in
the context of DevOps and system administration.


#### *Here's a brief description of each task:*

    Create a SSH RSA key pair:
    You need to create an RSA key pair and share the public key. This is commonly used for secure access to remote
    servers via SSH.

    For Best School loop:
    Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.

    While Best School loop:
    Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.

    Until Best School loop:
    Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.

    If 9, say Hi!:
    Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, it displays "Hi" on a new line
    using a while loop and
    an if statement.

    4 bad luck, 8 is your chance:
    Write a Bash script that loops from 1 to 10, displaying "bad luck" for the 4th iteration, "good luck" for the 8th
    iteration, and "Best School" for the other iterations using a while loop and if, elif, and else statements.
    
    Superstitious numbers:
    Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20, appending specific messages for the 4th, 9th, and 17th
    iterations using a while
    loop and the case statement.

    For ls:
    Create a Bash script that lists the contents of the current directory in a specific format. It should only display
    the part of the name
    after the first dash using a for loop and exclude hidden files.

    To file, or not to file:
    Write a Bash script that checks for the existence and characteristics of a file named "school." It should use if and
    else statements to
    report whether the file exists, is empty, and whether it is a regular file.

    FizzBuzz:
    Create a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with
    "Buzz," and multiples
    of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz." Other numbers should be displayed as is.
