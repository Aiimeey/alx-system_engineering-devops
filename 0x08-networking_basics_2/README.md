By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of networking fundamentals and develop practical skills related to IP configuration, port listening, and IP discovery.
Learning Objectives

### *Project Tasks*
#### *0. Change Your Home IP*

Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with specific IP address mappings. This script will change the resolution of the hostname "localhost" to 127.0.0.2 and "facebook.com" to 8.8.8.8. By running this script, you will observe the changes in hostname resolution. Be cautious when making these changes on a machine you plan to continue using.
##### *1. Show Attached IPs*

Create a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it's executed on. This script will help you identify the active IPv4 IPs associated with the machine, including the localhost IP.
#### *2. Port Listening on Localhost (Advanced)*

Develop a Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost. This script allows you to establish a connection using telnet and send text to the listening port. This exercise can be helpful for debugging socket connection issues, testing network configurations, or working on firewall rules.
