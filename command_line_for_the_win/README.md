### *Command Line for the Win*

This is an optional project designed to challenge and improve your command line skills. It consists of multiple
tasks, and completing each task will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. If your current average is
greater than your score on this project, your average might go down, so only take on this project if you're
comfortable with the command line and enjoy a challenge. Have fun and improve your Bash skills!
